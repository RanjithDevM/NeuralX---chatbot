            //Elon musk//
            "elon musk":`Elon Reeve Musk (/ˈiːlɒn mʌsk/; born June 28, 1971) is a businessman and U.S. special government employee, best known for his key roles in Tesla, Inc., SpaceX, and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), and his ownership of Twitter. Musk is the wealthiest individual in the world; as of February 2025, Forbes estimates his net worth to be US$397 billion.
            \nMusk was born to an affluent South African family in Pretoria before immigrating to Canada, acquiring its citizenship from his mother. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University, and with his brother Kimbal co-founded the software company Zip2, that was later acquired by Compaq in 1999. That same year, Musk co-founded X.com, a direct bank, that later formed PayPal. In 2002, Musk acquired U.S. citizenship, and eBay acquired PayPal. Using the money he made from the sale, Musk founded SpaceX, a spaceflight services company, in 2002. In 2004, Musk was an early investor in electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla and became its chairman and later CEO. In 2018, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Musk for fraud, alleging he falsely announced that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla; he stepped down as chairman and paid a fine. Musk was named Time magazine's Person of the Year in 2021. In 2022, he acquired Twitter, and rebranded the service as X the following year. In January 2025, he was appointed head of Trump's newly created DOGE.
            \nHis political activities and views have made him a polarizing figure. He has been criticized for making unscientific and misleading statements, including COVID-19 misinformation, affirming antisemitic and transphobic comments, and promoting conspiracy theories. His acquisition of Twitter was controversial due to a subsequent increase in hate speech and the spread of misinformation on the service. Musk has engaged in political activities in several countries, including as a vocal and financial supporter of U.S. president Donald Trump. He was the largest donor in the 2024 United States presidential election, and has been a supporter of right-wing activists, causes, and political parties.

            See also: Musk family
            Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa's administrative capital. He is of British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry. His mother, Maye (née Haldeman), is a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada, and raised in South Africa. His father, Errol Musk, is a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, emerald dealer, and property developer, who partly owned a rental lodge at Timbavati Private Nature Reserve.Elon has a younger brother, Kimbal, a younger sister, Tosca, as well as four paternal half-siblings.[18][19][8][20] Musk was raised in the Anglican Church, in which he was baptized.
            \nThe Musk family was wealthy during Elon's youth.[17] Despite both Elon and Errol previously stating that Errol was a part owner of a Zambian emerald mine,[17] in 2023, Errol recounted that the deal he made was to receive "a portion of the emeralds produced at three small mines".Errol was elected to the Pretoria City Council as a representative of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party and has said that his children shared their father's dislike of apartheid.
            \nAfter his parents divorced in 1980, Elon chose to live primarily with his father.[4][14] Elon later regretted his decision and became estranged from his father.[25] Elon has recounted trips to a wilderness school that he described as a "paramilitary Lord of the Flies" where "bullying was a virtue" and children were encouraged to fight over rations.[26] In one incident, after an altercation with a fellow pupil, Elon was thrown down concrete steps and beaten severely, leading to him being hospitalized for his injuries.[27] Elon described his father berating him after he was discharged from the hospital.[27] Errol denied berating Elon and claimed, "The boy had just lost his father to suicide and Elon had called him stupid. Elon had a tendency to call people stupid. How could I possibly blame that child?"[28]

            \nElon was an enthusiastic reader of books, and had attributed his success in part to having read The Lord of the Rings, the Foundation series, and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.[16][29] At age ten, he developed an interest in computing and video games, teaching himself how to program from the VIC-20 user manual.[30] At age twelve, Elon sold his BASIC-based game Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately $500.[31][32]

            \n-->Education<--
            Musk graduated from Pretoria Boys High School in South Africa.
            Musk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School, Bryanston High School, and then Pretoria Boys High School, where he graduated.[33] Musk was a good but unexceptional student, earning a 61 in Afrikaans and a B on his senior math certification.[34] Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother to avoid South Africa's mandatory military service,[35][36] which would have forced him to participate in the apartheid regime,[2] as well as to ease his path to immigration to the United States.[37] While waiting for his application to be processed, he attended the University of Pretoria for five months.[38]

            \nMusk arrived in Canada in June 1989, connected with a second cousin in Saskatchewan,[39] and worked odd jobs including at a farm and a lumber mill.[40] In 1990, he entered Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.[41][42] Two years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he studied until 1995.[43] Although Musk has said that he earned his degrees in 1995, the University of Pennsylvania did not award them until 1997 – a Bachelor of Arts in physics and a Bachelor of Science in economics from the university's Wharton School.[44][45][46][47][48] He reportedly hosted large, ticketed house parties to help pay for tuition, and wrote a business plan for an electronic book-scanning service similar to Google Books.[49]

            \nIn 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley: one at energy storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute, which investigated electrolytic supercapacitors for energy storage, and another at Palo Alto–based startup Rocket Science Games.[50][51] In 1995, he was accepted to a graduate program in materials science at Stanford University, but did not enroll.[46][44][52] Musk decided to join the Internet boom, applying for a job at Netscape, to which he reportedly never received a response.[53][35] The Washington Post reported that Musk lacked legal authorization to remain and work in the United States after failing to enroll at Stanford.[52] In response, Musk said he was allowed to work at that time and that his student visa transitioned to an H1-B. According to numerous former business associates and shareholders, Musk said he was on a student visa at the time.[54]

            In 1995, Musk, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded web software company Zip2 with funds borrowed from Musk's father.[55][25] They housed the venture at a small rented office in Palo Alto.[56] The company developed and marketed an Internet city guide for the newspaper publishing industry, with maps, directions, and yellow pages.[57]

            \nAccording to Musk, "The website was up during the day and I was coding it at night, seven days a week, all the time."[56] The Musk brothers obtained contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune,[58] and persuaded the board of directors to abandon plans for a merger with CitySearch.[59] Musk's attempts to become CEO were thwarted by the board.[60] Compaq acquired Zip2 for $307 million in cash in February 1999,[61][62] and Musk received $22 million for his 7-percent share.[63]

            \nX.com and PayPal
            Main articles: X.com (bank), PayPal, and PayPal Mafia
            In 1999, Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company.[64] The startup was one of the first federally insured online banks, and, in its initial months of operation, over 200,000 customers joined the service.[65] The company's investors regarded Musk as inexperienced and replaced him with Intuit CEO Bill Harris by the end of the year.[66] The following year, X.com merged with online bank Confinity to avoid competition.[56][66][67] Founded by Max Levchin and Peter Thiel,[68] Confinity had its own money-transfer service, PayPal, which was more popular than X.com's service.[69]

            \nWithin the merged company, Musk returned as CEO. Musk's preference for Microsoft software over Unix created a rift in the company and caused Thiel to resign.[70] Due to resulting technological issues and lack of a cohesive business model, the board ousted Musk and replaced him with Thiel in 2000.[71][b] Under Thiel, the company focused on the PayPal service and was renamed PayPal in 2001.[73][74] In 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock, of which Musk—the largest shareholder with 11.72% of shares—received $175.8 million.[75][76] In 2017, Musk purchased the domain X.com from PayPal for an undisclosed amount, stating that it had sentimental value.[77][78]

            In 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society and discussed funding plans to place a growth-chamber for plants on Mars.[79] Seeking a way to launch the greenhouse payloads into space, Musk made two unsuccessful trips to Moscow to purchase intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) from Russian companies NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras. Musk instead decided to start a company to build affordable rockets.[80] With $100 million of his early fortune,[81] Musk founded SpaceX in May 2002 and became the company's CEO and Chief Engineer.[82][83]

            \nSpaceX attempted its first launch of the Falcon 1 rocket in 2006.[84] Although the rocket failed to reach Earth orbit, it was awarded a Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program contract from NASA, then led by Mike Griffin.[85][86] After two more failed attempts that nearly caused Musk to go bankrupt,[84] SpaceX succeeded in launching the Falcon 1 into orbit in 2008.[87] Later that year, SpaceX received a $1.6 billion NASA contract for Falcon 9-launched Dragon spacecraft flights to the International Space Station (ISS), replacing the Space Shuttle after its 2011 retirement.[88] In 2012, the Dragon vehicle docked with the ISS, a first for a commercial spacecraft.[89]

            \nWorking towards its goal of reusable rockets, in 2015 SpaceX successfully landed the first stage of a Falcon 9 on a land platform.[90] Later landings were achieved on autonomous spaceport drone ships, an ocean-based recovery platform.[91] In 2018, SpaceX launched the Falcon Heavy; the inaugural mission carried Musk's personal Tesla Roadster as a dummy payload.[92][93] Since 2019,[94] SpaceX has been developing Starship, a reusable, super heavy-lift launch vehicle intended to replace the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy.[95] In 2020, SpaceX launched its first crewed flight, the Demo-2, becoming the first private company to place astronauts into orbit and dock a crewed spacecraft with the ISS.[96] In 2024, NASA awarded SpaceX an $843 million contract to deorbit the ISS at the end of its lifespan.[97]

            \nDuring the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Musk provided free Starlink service to Ukraine, permitting Internet access and communication at a yearly cost to SpaceX of $400 million.[103][104][105][106][107] However, Musk refused to block Russian state media on Starlink.[108][109] In 2023, Musk denied Ukraine's request to activate Starlink over Crimea to aid an attack against the Russian navy, citing fears of a nuclear response.[110][111][112]

            Musk next to a Tesla Model S, 2011
            Tesla, Inc., originally Tesla Motors, was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. Both men played active roles in the company's early development prior to Musk's involvement.[113] Musk led the Series A round of investment in February 2004; he invested $6.35 million, became the majority shareholder, and joined Tesla's board of directors as chairman.[114][115] Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design, but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.[116] Following a series of escalating conflicts in 2007, and the financial crisis of 2007–2008, Eberhard was ousted from the firm.[117][page needed][118] Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect in 2008.[119] A 2009 lawsuit settlement with Eberhard designated Musk as a Tesla co-founder, along with Tarpenning and two others.[120][121] Musk resigned from chairman of the board as part of the settlement of a lawsuit from the SEC over him tweeting that funding had been "secured" for potentially taking Tesla private.[122][123]

            \nTesla began delivery of the Roadster, an electric sports car, in 2008. With sales of about 2,500 vehicles, it was the first mass production all-electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells.[124] Under Musk, Tesla has since launched several well-selling electric vehicles, including the four-door sedan Model S (2012), the crossover Model X (2015), the mass-market sedan Model 3 (2017), the crossover Model Y (2020), and the pickup truck Cybertruck (2023).[125][126][127][128][129] The company has also constructed multiple lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle factories, called Gigafactories.[130] Since its initial public offering in 2010,[131] Tesla stock has risen significantly; it became the most valuable carmaker in summer 2020,[132][133] and it entered the S&P 500 later that year.[134][135] In October 2021, it reached a market capitalization of $1 trillion, the sixth company in US history to do so.[136]

            Musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for SolarCity, which his cousins Lyndon and Peter Rive founded in 2006.[137] By 2013, SolarCity was the second largest provider of solar power systems in the United States.[138] In 2014, Musk promoted the idea of SolarCity building an advanced production facility in Buffalo, New York, triple the size of the largest solar plant in the United States.[139] Construction of the factory started in 2014 and was completed in 2017. It operated as a joint venture with Panasonic until early 2020.[140][141]

            \nTesla acquired SolarCity for $2 billion in 2016 and merged it with its battery unit to create Tesla Energy. The deal's announcement resulted in a more than 10% drop in Tesla's stock price; at the time, SolarCity was facing liquidity issues.[142] Multiple shareholder groups filed a lawsuit against Musk and Tesla's directors, stating that the purchase of SolarCity was done solely to benefit Musk and came at the expense of Tesla and its shareholders.[143][144] Tesla directors settled the lawsuit in January 2020, leaving Musk the sole remaining defendant.[145][146] Two years later, the court ruled in Musk's favor.[147]

            In 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology startup, with an investment of $100 million.[148][149] Neuralink aims to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence (AI) by creating devices that are embedded in the brain. Such technology could enhance memory or allow the devices to communicate with software.[149][150] The company also hopes to develop devices to treat neurological conditions like spinal cord injuries.[151] In 2022, Neuralink announced that clinical trials would begin by the end of the year.[152] In September 2023, the Food and Drug Administration approved Neuralink to initiate six-year human trials.[153]

            \nNeuralink has conducted animal testing on macaques at the University of California, Davis. In 2021, the company released a video in which a Macaque played the video game Pong via a Neuralink implant. The company's animal trials—which have caused the deaths of some monkeys—have led to claims of animal cruelty. The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine has alleged that Neuralink violated the Animal Welfare Act.[154] Employees have complained that pressure from Musk to accelerate development has led to botched experiments and unnecessary animal deaths. In 2022, a federal probe was launched into possible animal welfare violations by Neuralink.[155]

            In 2017, Musk founded the Boring Company to construct tunnels, and revealed plans for specialized, underground, high-occupancy vehicles that could travel up to 150 miles per hour (240 km/h) and thus circumvent above-ground traffic in major cities.[156][157] Early in 2017, the company began discussions with regulatory bodies and initiated construction of a 30-foot (9.1 m) wide, 50-foot (15 m) long, and 15-foot (4.6 m) deep "test trench" on the premises of SpaceX's offices, as that required no permits.[158] The Los Angeles tunnel, less than two miles (3.2 km) in length, debuted to journalists in 2018. It used Tesla Model Xs and was reported to be a rough ride while traveling at suboptimal speeds.[159] Two tunnel projects announced in 2018, in Chicago and West Los Angeles, have been canceled.[160][161] However, a tunnel beneath the Las Vegas Convention Center was completed in early 2021.[162] Local officials have approved further expansions of the tunnel system.[163]

            \nApril 14, 2022[164]
            \n In early 2017, Musk expressed interest in buying Twitter and had questioned the platform's commitment to freedom of speech.[165][166][167] By 2022, Musk had reached 9.2% stake in the company,[168] making him the largest shareholder.[169][d] Musk later agreed to a deal that would appoint him to Twitter's board of directors and prohibit him from acquiring more than 14.9% of the company.[171][172] Days later, Musk made a $43 billion offer to buy Twitter.[169][173] By the end of April Musk had successfully concluded his bid for approximately $44 billion.[174] This included approximately $12.5 billion in loans and $21 billion in equity financing.[175][176] Having back tracked on his initial decision,[177] Musk bought the company on October 27, 2022.[178]

            \nImmediately after the acquisition, Musk fired several top Twitter executives including CEO Parag Agrawal;[178][179] Musk became the CEO instead.[180] Under Elon Musk, Twitter instituted monthly subscription for a "blue check",[181][182][183] and laid off a significant portion of the company's staff.[184][185] Musk lessened content moderation and hate speech also increased on the platform after his takeover.[186][187][188][189] In late 2022, Musk released internal documents relating to Twitter's moderation of Hunter Biden's laptop controversy in the lead-up to the 2020 presidential election.[190] Musk also promised to step down as CEO after a Twitter poll,[191][192] and five months later, Musk stepped down from chief executive officer (CEO) and transitioned his role to executive chairman and chief technology officer (CTO).[193]

            \nDespite Musk stepping down as CEO, X continues to struggle with challenges such as viral misinformation,[194] hate speech, and antisemitism controversies.[195][196] Musk has been accused of trying to silence some of his critics[197] by removing their accounts' blue checkmarks, which hinders visibility and is considered a form of shadow banning,[198][199] or suspending their accounts without justification.[200]

Musk obtained funding from investors in SpaceX and Tesla,[210] and xAI hired engineers from Google and OpenAI.[211]

            Musk uses a private jet owned by Falcon Landing LLC, a SpaceX-linked company, and acquired a second jet in August 2020.[213][214] His heavy use of the jets and the consequent fossil fuel usage have received criticism.[213][215] Musk's flight usage is tracked on social media through ElonJet.[216][217][218] In December 2022, Musk banned the ElonJet account on Twitter, as well as temporary bans on the accounts of journalists that posted stories regarding the incident, including Donie O'Sullivan, Keith Olbermann, and journalists from The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN, and The Intercept.[219]

            \nMain article: Political activities of Elon Musk
            \nMusk with then-president-elect Donald Trump in November 2024
            \nMusk is an outlier among executives who typically avoid partisan political advocacy.[220][221][222] Musk was a registered independent voter when he lived in California.[223] Historically, he has donated to both Democrats and Republicans,[224] many of whom serve in states in which he has a vested interest.[225] Beginning in 2022, his political contributions have mostly supported Republicans, with his first vote for a Republican going to Representative Mayra Flores in the 2022 Texas's 34th congressional district special election.[226][227] In 2024, he started supporting international far-right political parties, activists, and causes,[228] and has shared far-right misinformation[229][230][231] and numerous conspiracy theories.[232][233] As of 2024 his views were generally described as right-wing.[234]

            \nMusk supported Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012,[235] Hillary Clinton in 2016, Joe Biden in 2020,[236] and Donald Trump in 2024.[237] In the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Musk endorsed candidate Andrew Yang and expressed support for Yang's proposed universal basic income,[238] and endorsed Kanye West's 2020 presidential campaign.[239] In 2021, Musk publicly expressed opposition to the Build Back Better Act, a $3.5 trillion legislative package endorsed by Joe Biden that ultimately failed to pass due to unanimous opposition from congressional Republicans and several Democrats.[240] In 2022, Musk said he would start supporting Republican Party candidates,[241] and gave over $50 million to Citizens for Sanity, a conservative political action committee.[242] In 2023, he supported Republican Ron DeSantis for the 2024 US presidential election, giving $10 million to his campaign,[242] and hosted DeSantis's campaign announcement on a Twitter Spaces event.[243][244][245] From June 2023 to January 2024, Musk hosted a bipartisan set of X Spaces with Republican and Democratic candidates, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,[246] Vivek Ramaswamy,[247] and Dean Phillips.[248]

            \nMusk at a 2024 gathering with Trump and other political leaders
            By early 2024, Musk had become a vocal and financial supporter of Donald Trump.[249] In July 2024, after the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, Musk endorsed him for president.[250][251] During the presidential campaign, Musk joined Trump on stage at a campaign rally,[252] and during the campaign promoted conspiracy theories and falsehoods about Democrats, election fraud[253] and immigration, in support of Trump.[254][255] Musk was the largest individual donor of the 2024 election.[256]

            \nMusk's international political actions and comments have come under increasing scrutiny and criticism, especially from the governments and leaders of France, Germany, Norway, Spain and the United Kingdom, due to his position in the US government.[257][258][259]

            Musk giving a gesture at the second inauguration of Donald Trump before saying "My heart goes out to you. It is thanks to you that the future of civilization is assured."[260][261]
            \nIn his speech during the second inauguration of Donald Trump, Musk thumped his right hand over his heart, fingers spread wide, and then extended his right arm out, emphatically, at an upward angle, palm down and fingers together. He then repeated the gesture to the crowd behind him. As he finished the gestures, he said to the crowd, "My heart goes out to you. It is thanks to you that the future of civilization is assured."[260][261][262] The gesture was viewed as a Nazi or Roman salute[e] by some.[263][264][265] Musk derided the claims as politicized.[266][267] In a social media post, he wrote: "The 'everyone is Hitler' attack is sooo tired",[268] but did not explicitly deny the claims.[269] In further response to the events, Musk posted a series of puns about Nazis on Twitter.[270] Various media outlets, including the Associated Press, reported that regardless of what Musk meant, his gesture was widely embraced by right-wing extremists and neo-Nazis.[269][271]

            \nDepartment of Government Efficiency
            \nMain article: Department of Government Efficiency
            The concept of DOGE emerged in a discussion between Musk and Donald Trump, and in August 2024, Trump committed to giving Musk an advisory role, with Musk accepting the offer.[272] In November and December 2024, Musk suggested that the organization could help to cut the U.S. federal budget, consolidate the number of federal agencies,[273][274] and eliminate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,[275][276] and that its final stage would be "deleting itself".[277]

            \n In January 2025, the organization was created by executive order, and Musk was designated a "special government employee".[278][279] Musk is leading the organization, although his official role is not clear.[280] In February 2025, Musk was criticized for his treatment of government employees.[281][282][283] Musk has prioritized secrecy within the organization[284] and accused others of violating privacy laws.

//Bible
"genesis chapter 1:": 
`1.THE CREATION 1In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 
 2. Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness covered the surface of the watery depths, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters. 
3 Then God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. 
4 God saw that the light was good, and God separated the light from the darkness. 
5 God called the light “day,” and the darkness he called “night.” There was an evening, and there was a morning: one day. 
6 Then God said, “Let there be an expanse between the waters, separating water from water.” 
7 So God made the expanse and separated the water under the expanse from the water above the expanse. And it was so. 
8 God called the expanse “sky.” b Evening came and then morning: the second day.
 9 Then God said, “Let the water under the sky be gathered into one place, and let the dry land appear.” And it was so. 
10 God called the dry land “earth,” and the gathering of the water he called “seas.” And God saw that it was good. 
11 Then God said, “Let the earth produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and fruit trees on the earth bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds.” And it was so. 
12 The earth produced vegetation: seed-bearing plants according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. 
13 Evening came and then morning: the third day. 
14 Then God said, “Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to separate the day from the night. They will serve as signs for seasons c and for days and years. 
15 They will be lights in the expanse of the sky to provide light on the earth.” And it was so. 
16 God made the two great lights — the greater light to rule over the day and the lesser light to rule over the night — as well as the stars. 
17 God placed them in the expanse of the sky to provide light on the earth, 
18 to rule the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good. 
19 Evening came and then morning: the fourth day. 
20 Then God said, “Let the water swarm withd living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the sky.” 
21 So God created the large sea-creaturese and every living creature that moves and swarms in the water, according to their kinds. He also created every winged creature according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. 
22 God blessed them: “Be fruitful, multiply, and fill the waters of the seas, and let the birds multiply on the earth.” 
23 Evening came and then morning: the fifth day. 
24 Then God said, “Let the earth produce living creatures according to their kinds: livestock, creatures that crawl, and the wildlife of the earth according to their kinds.” And it was so. 
25 So God made the wildlife of the earth according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that crawl on the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. 
26 Then God said, “Let us make manf ing our image, according to our likeness. They will rule the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, the livestock, the whole earth, h and the creatures that crawli on the earth.” 
27 So God created man in his own image; he created him inj the image of God; he created them male and female. 
28 God blessed them, and God said to them, “Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth, and subdue it. Rule the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, and every creature that crawls k on the earth.”
 29 God also said, “Look, I have given you every seed-bearing plant on the surface of the entire earth and every tree whose fruit contains seed. This will be food for you, 
30 for all the wildlife of the earth, for every bird of the sky, and for every creature that crawls on the earth — everything having the breath of life in it — I have givenl every green plant for food.” And it was so. 
31 God saw all that he had made, and it was very good indeed. Evening came and then morning: the sixth day.`,
