# NeuralX---chatbot
NeuralX – Simple Chatbot NeuralX is a chatbot that talks with users using preset answers. It understands keywords in what you type and replies with matching responses. It can also ask follow-up questions to make the chat more natural.  Features: Responds based on keywords. Built with Basic HTML,CSS, and JS

I mainly integrated it with Wikipedia, so it can show images along with the responses.
It can also solve basic math problems quickly.
Right now, it's just 1% complete — I'm still working on upgrading it to behave more like an AI.

If you notice any spelling mistakes in the questions, please correct them.
Also, if there are any updates or improvements I should make, feel free to let me know.

Thank you!
